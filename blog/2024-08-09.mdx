# Welcome to Our Blog!
Initially, our goal was to extend Rhythmbox to integrate with network service providers. However, we faced a significant hurdle: the integration required Python3, a technology with which we were not very familiar. The learning curve and complexity led us to reconsider our approach.

Instead of struggling with Python3, we decided to develop a new application from scratch. Our new app will not only serve as a local music player but will also feature a modern, intuitive UI design. We are committed to delivering a visually appealing and user-friendly experience that aligns with current design trends.

### Key Features of Our New App:

- **Modern UI Design:** Our app will feature a sleek and contemporary user interface, crafted to enhance usability and provide a visually pleasing experience.

- **Customizable Interface:** Users will have the flexibility to personalize the app's appearance to suit their preferences.

- **Built with Popular JS/TS Technologies:** We will leverage JavaScript and TypeScript, two of the most popular and powerful technologies in modern frontend development. This ensures a responsive, efficient, and scalable application, utilizing the latest advancements in web technologies.

In the upcoming posts, we’ll share more about our development process, the cutting-edge technologies we’re using, and how we’re crafting a custom and modern user experience. Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for joining us on this exciting journey!
